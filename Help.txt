Quick refresher on the BSD syslog format (RFC 3164):
The components are:
	- PRI
	- timestamp
	- hostname
	- message body

They are layed out as follows:
<PRI>timestamp hostname messageBodyTheRestOfTheWay

PRI is the facility number (facility means a particular subsystem) multiplied by 8, and then the severity added to it.  Technically the timestamp and hostname are conceptually grouped together as a "header", but it is easier and makes more sense to parse them as two separate components.  FYI, everything is a 1 byte char (ASCII)

***General usage***
DumbSyslogViewer should automatically connect to the configured DumbSyslogServer and begin pulling logs that are stored in the server's buffer.  As messages are received by the server, they are pushed out to any viewers that are connected.  If at any time you believe that there have been new syslogs, but you don't appear to be receiving any, then restart the application.  This will force a state reset and reconnect to the server.  However, if a disconnection occurs it should continually it reconnections.  As it currently stands, the timestamp is based off of the time that the server received the messages.  This is in contrary to the BSD syslog standard, but this does prevent log synchronization issues.  The self-reported timestamp can be viewed in DumbSyslogServer's log archive.

***Filters***
There are two main filter types: inclusion and exclusion.  Inclusion mandates that a syslog hostname or message body contains a specified phrase in order to be displayed.  Exclusion mandates that a syslog hostname or message body does not contain a specified phrase in order to be displayed.  If more than one phrase is speficied in a single filter, then those phrase conditions are OR'd.  I.e., if an inclusion filter has two message body phrases of type "auth" and "session", then a syslog message will be displayed if it contains either the phrases "auth" OR "session".  Similarly, if an exclusion filter has two message body phrases of type "auth" and "session", then a syslog message will be not display if it contain either phrase "auth" or "session".  You cannot mix different types inside one filter.  It must be composed of only one type (only checking hostnames, only checking message bodies, etc...)  Phrases are case sensitive.  A work-around for this is using more phrases in one filter (e.g. case Case CASE.)

***Combined filter behavior***
If there are multiple filters active at one time, then the filters are logically AND'd together.  In other words, a syslog message must meet the requirements of ALL filters in order to be displayed.  Because filters are only logically AND'd, filter order does not matter.

***Filter save behavior***
Filters are automatically saved to disk when they are applied.  If you close DumbSyslogViewer after applying filters, they will be re-applied on startup.

***Filter editing***
The primary way in which filters should be modified is through the use of the CLI available in the main window.  DumbSyslogViewer uses SOFFIT (github.com/cguy777/JSoffit) as the framework for filter modification and management.  The editor window is primarily in place to provide a quick reference of what filters are configured, but they can also be edited directly in the window.  The "number" field inside a filter is purely for reference purposes and has no logical affect on the filter behavior whatsoever.  In fact, you can remove the number fields and then apply the filters with no consequence.  The number field will automatically be re-added after an apply has been performed.
